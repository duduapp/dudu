## Install
I use flutter 1.22.6 in this project, you can use [fvm](https://github.com/fluttertools/fvm) to manage flutter versions.
If you choose to use fvm, after install fvm, run following commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/duduapp/dudu
cd dudu
fvm install 1.22.6
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
```
That should run the app if your have ios or android simulator opened.
